# Neural Net Snakes

This was my first venture into C++ and the goal was to learn the syntax and to get some more practice with the windows library. I have also never done any graphics before this so it was a great thing to learn. 

This uses an evolution algorithm that evolves the neural net through breeding and random mutations between generations.

The overall lessons I have learnt from this project were:
* Neural net operation
* Graphics processing
* Windows library
* C++ syntax
