# Neural Net Snakes

This was my first venture into C++ and the goal was to learn the syntax and to get some more practice with the windows library. I have also never done any graphics before this so it was a great thing to learn. 

My plan was to use genetic algorithms to teach the snakes how to find food. However, at the current point of the project I think that goal is out of the scope of what I wanted to learn from this. 

The overall lessons I have learnt from this project were:
* Neural net operation
* Graphics processing
* Windows library
* C++ syntax

I have plans of coming back to this but I would rather move on to learning something else for now.
